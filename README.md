## Overview
This is my seventh Frontend Mentor challenge. The task is undertaken with an intent to improve my frontend development skills as a junior frontend developer.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size

## My process

A sketch was used to approximate dimensions and how to set up the flex layout. Remote git repository was created for the project before development commenced.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first approach 

### What I learned

Using utility classes in the HTML, as in Tailwind approach, was fun. With this approach, I had to almost rewrite the stylesheet for media queries. Making mobile screens inherit the desktop properties was easier in this sprint. 

I struggled less with this project hence it was more interesting. I am eager to improve my frontend development skills by working on more projects in order to write cleaner and more efficient codes. 

I will appreciate and welcome all suggestions please.



### Continued development

- manipulation of background images to produce better design.
- use clamp() for responsiveness of banners. 
- better naming convention used for future projects such as BEM.
- Media query with advanced website layouts.
- writing cleaner, scalable and easy to maintain code.
- use common frameworks such as Tailwind and Bootstrap for future projects.

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/duokobia/Profile-card-component/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/duokobia/Profile-card-component/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
